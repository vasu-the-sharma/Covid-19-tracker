# COVID-19 TRACKER

The coronavirus or Covid-19 is a large family of viruses that causes illnesses ranging from the common cold to acute respiratory syndromes, but the current virus is a novel strain not seen before. Common symptoms of the novel coronavirus strain include respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath, according to the WHO. 

India has been under lockdown from March 25 and is supposed to be till May 3. \
The only way we can ensure safety of ourselves and our beloved ones is by staying inside our houses and under self-quarantine. 

I have built this project which is a COVID-19 tracker that will show different results, the severity of the pandemic, the number of cases registered and how they increased over time, distribution of cases state wise in India, and the number of deaths. This project shows the effect of coronavirus worldwide. I have used COVID Cases in India dataset for this project and will make updates regularly. 

# stay inside, stay safe everyone!
