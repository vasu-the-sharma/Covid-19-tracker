# COVID-19 TRACKER

The coronavirus or Covid-19 is a large family of viruses that causes illnesses ranging from the common cold to acute respiratory syndromes, but the current virus is a novel strain not seen before. Common symptoms of the novel coronavirus strain include respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath, according to the WHO. 

I have built a Covid-19 tracker which will show different results, the severity of the pandemic, number of cases registered and how they increased over the time, distribution of cases state wise in India and number of deaths. 
This project shows the affect of coronavirus worldwide. I have used Covid Cases in India dataset for this project and will make updates regularly.

# STAY INSIDE, STAY SAFE
